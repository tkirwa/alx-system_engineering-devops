![Dramatic Incident](https://live.staticflickr.com/5474/14063148918_de4744ac3c_z.jpg)

**Issue Summary:**
- Duration: 4 hours, from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM (UTC-4)
- Impact: The Personal Budget App experienced slow response times, and users were unable to access their financial data. Approximately 60% of users were affected by the slowdown.
- Root Cause: An unoptimized database query was causing excessive load on the server, leading to performance degradation.

**Timeline:**
- Issue Detected: 2:00 PM
- Detection Method: Monitoring system triggered an alert for high CPU utilization on the database server.
- Actions Taken: Engineers investigated the server logs and identified high load on the database.
- Misleading Paths: Initial assumption pointed towards a memory leak in the application code, leading to unnecessary code profiling and optimizations.
- Escalation: Incident was escalated to the database administration team for deeper database performance analysis.
- Resolution: The unoptimized database query was identified and optimized to reduce server load. Service was restored at 6:00 PM.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- Root Cause: A specific query in the application was fetching excessive data from the database, causing a high number of database connections and CPU load.
- Resolution: The database query was restructured to fetch only the necessary data, reducing the load on the server and improving response times.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- Improvements:
  - Implement automated performance testing to identify bottlenecks in the application.
  - Enhance monitoring system to trigger alerts based on specific application and database performance metrics.
- Tasks:
  - Optimize all critical database queries to ensure efficient data retrieval.
  - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the frequency of database queries.
  - Review application code to identify and refactor any other potential performance bottlenecks.
